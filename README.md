# Mini-project 2: Wrangling the Simpsons

This project is an interactive data wrangling tutorial on how to use the following functions from the tidyr, dplyr and ggplot2 packages:
- filter() and arrange() to manipulate rows;
- select(), mutate() and summarize() to manipulate and create columns;
- join() to join tables together;
- ggplot()to visualize data.

The tutorial uses the [Simpson Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prashant111/the-simpsons-dataset/data) which contains character details, episode details, and script lines for approximately 600 Simpsons episodes. It was originally pulled by Tod Schenider in 2016 and uploaded by William Cukierski.

The tutorial also guides its user to answer the following questions:
- which season of the Simpsons has the highest IMDb rating;
- how has the IMDb ratings changed over the seasons;
- which character has the most spoken lines across all episodes;
- whether there is a relationship between word count and IMDb rating?
